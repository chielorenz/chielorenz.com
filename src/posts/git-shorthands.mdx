# Git shorthands

Over the years I've collected a few shorthands to make using Git from the command line faster and easier. These are
commands I'm comfortable with, your mileage may vary.

## Some basic commands

For the commands I use most frequently I created bash aliases by choosing a short but mnemonic name, like `gs` for
`git status` and `gb` for `git branch`, here a list of all my aliases:

```bash
alias gs="git status"
alias gb="git branch"
alias gbr="git branch --remotes"
alias gf="git fetch --all"
alias gd="git diff"
alias gpull="git fetch --all && git pull"
alias gpush="git push"
alias ga="git add"
alias gc="git commit -m"
alias gac="git commit -am"
alias gm="git merge"
alias gn="git checkout -b"
```

## How to checkout

An important command that is still missing is `git checkout`, which I wanted to implement in a "clever" way to
overcome the fact that branch names can get quite long and messy someting. I named it `gg` for "git go", a bash
function which takes a string and checks out on the branch that most resembles it.

```bash
gg () {
	# --format is to keep only branch name
	branches=$(git branch --format='%(refname:short)')

	# --max-count is to keep only first match
	branch=$(echo $branches | grep $1 --max-count 1)

	if ! git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/$branch; then
		echo No branch matching "'$1'" found locally; return;
	fi

	git checkout $branch
}
```

This let's me checkout branches by typing just enough characters to tell it apart other branches, for example to
checkout a branch named `production` I could use:

```bash
❯ gg prod
Switched to branch 'production'
```

And to checkout a branch named `release/2.0.4`:

```bash
❯ gg 0.4
Switched to branch 'release/2.0.4'
```

Obviously this isn't perfect, it's easy to make mistakes when there are branches with similar names, but usually a `gb`
to list all the branches is enough to find the right keywords to make it work.

This command deliberately checks only local branches to limit name collisions when there are dozens if not hundreds of
branches in the remote, but what if the branch is not present locally? The command `ggr` "git go remote" it's meant for
this:

```bash
ggr () {
	# --format is to keep only branch name
	# --all to get local and remote branch
	branches=$(git branch --all --format='%(refname:short)')

	# --max-count is to keep only first match
	branch=$(echo $branches | grep $1 --max-count 1)

	# Ensure to checkout the local branch
	[[ $branch == origin/* ]] && branch=$(echo $branch | cut -c 8-)

	git checkout $branch
}
```

To checkout a remote branch named `feature/auth` I could use:

```shell
ggr auth
branch 'feature/auth' set up to track 'origin/feature/auth'.
Switched to a new branch 'feature/auth'
```

## Pretty log

TODO

```bash
alias gl="git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
```

## Documenting commands

I added doc block

```bash
# @doc gg [branch]: Checkout a local git branch by searching for it
```

That can be red with this function

```bash
glist () {
    grep -oh '^# @doc.\+' \
        $filename |                     # match doc tags
        cut -c 8- |                     # remove the '# @doc ' part
        grep '^[^:]\+' --color=always   # color the command name
}
```

And produces:

```shell
❯ glist
gg [branch]: Checkout a local git branch by searching for it
```
